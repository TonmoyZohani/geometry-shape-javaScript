            The full meaning of DOM is Document Object Model.DOM represents the
            HTML pages in such a way that it can be easily modified with
            programming language. <br />
            When we write a webpage in HTML, we can see it through the browser.
         Basically what we see in the browser and what we see in the
            page source are the same. But DOM represents this document in an
            object oriented way so that we can interact with this page with the
            help of DOM.With
            the help of DOM we can access everything on our page, modify it
            easily if needed.

            <span class="text-green-600">Answer:</span>
            We can select elements in DOM by using various selectors. Here are,
            <br />
            <ol class="font-medium">
                <li>1.getElementById()</li>
                <li>2.getElementsByTagName()</li>
                <li>3.getElementsByClassName()</li>
                <li>4.querySelector()</li>
                <li>5.querySelectorAll()</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          </h3>
          <p class="font-medium mb-2">
            <span class="text-green-600">Answer:</span>
            A JavaScript event-handling concept is called event bubbling.<br />
             When an event happens in the event handler function, it can be sent from one single event handler to another single event handler. Once the original event has begun, all related events are handled in the following map.
When an event takes place in one of the event handlers, that event tries to move forward to the next handler if there is one.

            <span class="text-green-600">Answer:</span>
            A callback function is simply a function that is executed after another function is executed. And that's why it's called a callback function.<br />
           It helps developers to write asynchronous JavaScript code and avoids errors and problems.Because It make sure that a function won't execute before the task is finished, but will instead run immediately after the task has finished.
